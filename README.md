> This autonomous driving framework (named UDMC) is based on nonparametric Bayesian learning and optimization methods, so it is lightweight, interpretable, and adaptable to various driving scenarios.

- This project contains the necessary code for our presented Unified Decision-Making and Control (UDMC) scheme for urban driving. 
- The purpose of this project is to build a uniformed, versatile and light-weighted autonomous driving framework for both decision-making and motion control.
- This driving framework settles the complex traffic rule compliance problem using the artificial potential field (APF), rather than if-else commands in most current rule-based methods.
- We tested it on varieties of scenarios (car following, overtaking, roundabout, intersection, T-junction, etc.) and `CARLA Town05 Benchmark`.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->


## Usage
Before running the following codes, CARLA Simulator should be active.
```Shell
cd /opt/carla-simulator # Open the folder where CARLA is installed
./CarlaUE4.sh
```
In another terminal:
```Shell
cd udmc_carla # Open the folder where this repository exists
```
### Run the UDMC with `CARLA Town05` Benchmark
**Change to the branch of `town05short`**, and then run the following command:
```Shell
cd leaderboard/scripts
# Run the CARLA Town05 Benchmark automatically
./local_evaluation.sh 
```
Wait until the program is finished, and the evaluation result on the Town05 Short Benchmark can be inspected in the `results` folder.

## Project Status
Project is: _complete_
